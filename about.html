          My name is Krit Dass and I'm a junior in high school. My main
          interests are in computer science and biology, and I want to have a
          career in bioinformatics in the future.

          I have been programming since I was 12, starting from HTML and
          JavaScript. I have since learned several programming languages and
          frameworks. I mainly program in Python and JavaScript, having created
          several projects in both, which you can see on my

          These days, I am learning electric guitar, Rust (a programming
          language), and UI design, all while keeping up with school. I recently
          also started using Linux and am learning about its ecosystem and
          open-source software in general (while making some of my own).
