        First, let's start with some background. When I started learning web
        development in 7th grade, I didn't know that frameworks even existed. I
        used vanilla HTML and CSS to make a copy of a caf√© website and was
        amazed that I could <i>code</i> (the process was more copying the code
        of the original website than actual coding).

      <p class="post-desc">
        However, my search for even more capabilities led me to React. If you
        don't know, React is a web development framework that allows you to make
        a website using only JavaScript. Slowly but steadily, I learned React
        and started to make cool interactive websites.
      </p>
      <p class="post-desc">
        You may think of this as a remarkable achievement in my programming
        journey, but I regret it in hindsight. With React, I got introduced to
        libraries for <i>everything</i>. NPM became a superpower; whenever I
        needed something, I searched NPM. With this power came a caveat: I
        struggled to implement things I used to be able to implement easily. I
        forgot even HTML and found myself searching W3Schools for basic things.
        I became stuck in React.

        Recently, I switched to using Linux from Windows and decided to
        configure everything myself instead of using a desktop environment. With
        this advent, I got exposed to a world of open-source software and was
        surprised that a lot of it advertised simplicity. Why would anyone need
        simplicity when something could be <i>versatile</i>? I didn't understand
        this until I wrote my first major project that wasn't a website (<a
          href="https://github.com/kritdass/pytch"
          class="plain-link"
          target="_blank"
          >a fetch script</a
        >).
      </p>
      <p class="post-desc">
        Now, a fetch script displays system information and many run it on
        terminal startup. So, it has to be fast. I wrote my fetch script in
        Python, a language slower than most programming languages used for fetch
        scripts. So, to run fast, it had to be <i>simple</i>. This still doesn't
        explain why I believe simplicity is good, it's just for my particular
        usecase at the time.
      </p>
      <p class="post-desc">
        I am not too familiar with Python and often find myself consulting a
        reference, so writing complex code would have made this project hard to
        maintain. Moreover, it's easy for bugs to get introduced. If I was more
        experienced, it wouldn't matter for me but it does matter for those who
        want to contribute. We can see a good example of this when we look at
        the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/yshui/picom/blob/next/History.md"
          class="plain-link"
          target="_blank"
          >reason</a
        >
        Picom (an X11 compositor in Linux) was created. Compton, the program it
        was forked from, became unmaintained and
        <i>unmaintainable</i>. Now, Picom is much more popular than Compton and
        is actually maintained. Simplicity can be the difference between the
        success and failure of a project.

        Taking this back to React, React is <i>complex</i>. It is meant for
        dynamic websites, but here I was using it for static websites. I believe
        that you should use the tool that's fit for the job, not a
        one-size-fits-all tool. Yet, here I was doing the exact opposite. When I
        decided to make a personal website (yesterday), I decided to make it in
        vanilla HTML and CSS. No frameworks. No libraries. Why? Because a static
        website doesn't need a framework. A static website doesn't need the
        fancy stuff. And besides, I skipped the step in my web development
        journey where you're supposed to make cool HTML+CSS websites. I
        struggled with CSS even in React, and I wanted to fix that.
      </p>
      <p class="post-desc">
        So, this website is made in vanilla HTML and CSS with no frameworks and
        libraries, not even JavaScript. And it still looks cool. Sometimes you
        don't need a Swiss army knife to cut an onion and sometimes you don't
        need a framework to make a website. Just use the right tools for the job
        and keep it simple.
